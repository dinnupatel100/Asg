Q2. How to set multiple remote repositories for the same project? Explain the use case. you should have a working demo of it.
=>

Following are the steps to set multiple remote repositories for the same project.

1) To add local repo to remote repo use command "git remote add origin <link_of_repo>".
2) To check whether the remote repo is added, use command "git remote -v".
3) Push the local repo to remote using command "git push origin main"
4) To add another remote repo use command "git remote add origin <link_of_repo2>".
5) To check whether the remote repo is added, use command "git remote -v".
6) Push the local repo to remote using command "git push origin1 main"


Working Demo

1) Push the local repo to remote (repo1)

jspnlp@jspnlp-Inspiron-3501:~/dinesh/GIT/Practice$ ls
A1.txt  A2.txt  A3.txt  B2.txt
jspnlp@jspnlp-Inspiron-3501:~/dinesh/GIT/Practice$ git remote add origin https://github.com/dinnupatel100/repo1.git
fatal: remote origin already exists.
jspnlp@jspnlp-Inspiron-3501:~/dinesh/GIT/Practice$ git remote -v
origin	https://github.com/dinnupatel100/repo1.git (fetch)
origin	https://github.com/dinnupatel100/repo1.git (push)
jspnlp@jspnlp-Inspiron-3501:~/dinesh/GIT/Practice$ git push origin main
Enumerating objects: 8, done.
Counting objects: 100% (8/8), done.


2) Push the local repo to remote (repo2)

jspnlp@jspnlp-Inspiron-3501:~/dinesh/GIT/Practice$ git remote add origin1 https://github.com/dinnupatel100/repo2.git
jspnlp@jspnlp-Inspiron-3501:~/dinesh/GIT/Practice$ git remote -v
origin	https://github.com/dinnupatel100/repo1.git (fetch)
origin	https://github.com/dinnupatel100/repo1.git (push)
origin1	https://github.com/dinnupatel100/repo2.git (fetch)
origin1	https://github.com/dinnupatel100/repo2.git (push)
jspnlp@jspnlp-Inspiron-3501:~/dinesh/GIT/Practice$ git push origin1 main
Enumerating objects: 8, done.
Counting objects: 100% (8/8), done.


Use Case : 

1) If different teams are working on different aspects of a project, each team can have its own remote repository. This allows teams to work independently.
2) Maintaining a backup remote repository. If the primary remote server goes down or faces issues, you can switch to the backup repository.
